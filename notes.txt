Gouraud shading + Phong reflection

what does the vertex shader do ? 

- calculate diffuse light color
- calculate specular light color
- combine ambient + diffuse and specular light color and store it


What does the fragment shader do ? 

- interpolate between the light colors at every vertex and multiply by texture sample
